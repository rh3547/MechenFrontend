The shared module represents the parts of the application that will be frequently reused accross feature modules. It shouldnâ€™t have any dependencies to anywhere in the application, and should not rely on any other first-party module.

Everything created in the shared module should be reusable and lazy-loaded in the feature modules where they are used.

Only include commonly used directives, pipes, and components in the shared module.

Any third-party libraries available as "NgModules" (such as Ng Bootstrap, Material Design, etc) should be imported and exposed through this module.
