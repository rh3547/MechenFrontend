Feature modules represent the domain-specific functionality of the application. Each distinct feature should be created as its own module. These modules should only depend on the shared module, and all of their functionality should be scoped within its own angular module only.

Feature modules provide user experience dedicated to a particular application feature like "users". Each feature module groups components, services, models, and other functionality that is specific to the particular domain feature.
